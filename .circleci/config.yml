# # Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:
  # The python orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can use repeatedly in your configuration files
  node: circleci/node@4.1
  # The heroku orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize to deploy applications to heroku
  heroku: circleci/heroku@1.2


# Invoke jobs via workflows
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
workflows:
  sample: 
    # Inside the workflow, you define the jobs you want to run.
    jobs:
      - node/test
      - heroku/deploy-via-git: # we push to heroku
          force: true # this parameter instructs the push to use a force flag when pushing to the heroku remote, see: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git
          requires:
            - node/test # only run deploy-via-git job if the build job has completed
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
